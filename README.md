# Pandemic Severity Level Analysis Using Social Media

## Description
This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of pandemic severity levels using social media data, specifically Twitter. The project focuses on classifying COVID-19 related tweets into three categories: Need, Available, and not relevant. This classification helps in understanding the pandmeic severity and potentially identifying resource needs or availability.

## Contents
Due to the sensitive nature of the research and data privacy concerns, the actual code and data are not publicly available. This repository serves as a placeholder and provides general information about the project.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of approximately 14,000 tweets related to COVID-19, collected and labeled into three classes: need, available, and not relevant. The data is stored in an Excel file format.

## Methodology
The project involves several key steps:
1. Tweet scraping from Twitter
2. Data preprocessing
3. Labeling of tweets
4. Development of a classification model
5. Implementation and analysis

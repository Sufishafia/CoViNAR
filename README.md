# CoViNAR:A Context-Aware Social Media Dataset for Pandemic Severity Level Prediction and Analysis

## Overview
This project introduces the CoViNAR dataset, which consists of 14,000 tweets categorized into three classes:
Need (tweets requesting resources)
Available (tweets offering resources)
Not Related (irrelevant tweets)
The project focuses on classifying COVID-19 related tweets into three categories: Need, Available, and not relevant. This classification helps in understanding the pandmeic severity and potentially identifying resource needs or availability.

## Code and Dataset Availability
The python code and CoViNAR dataset is publicly available for research and development purposes. An extended dataset spanning November 2019 to March 2023 is not freely available due to sensitive nature of the research and data privacy concerns. However, this dataset can be shared upon request and under specific conditions.

## Methodology
The project involves several key steps:
1. Tweet scraping from X.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Initial filtering of tweets using BERTopic and Regex.
4. Labeling of tweets.
5. Training and texting of a classification model.
6. Implementation and analysis.
